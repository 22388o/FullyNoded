# Fully Noded p2p coinjoin - Blind psbts

Fully Noded v0.2.22 will include a new feature called "Blind psbts".

When this feature is toggled on from settings transactions will be created in a
way that breaks the common input output heuristic of 1 recipient output and 1
change output.

Blind psbts are different in that:

- no "change" outputs
- all address script types must match
- minimum 3 outputs
- minimum 3 inputs
- no address reuse allowed
- equal input amounts (for now)
- equal output amounts (for now)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è outputs will always have the mining fee deducted from them equally

## Initiating a blind psbt

In the simplest scenario User A wants to send a specific amount of btc to another
party who may or may not be a participant in the coinjoin. The idea being to make
every transaction a coinjoin.

User A adds an amount and address to the "Send" view as normal.

Fully Noded will find 3 identically denominated utxos that are under the control
of your wallet. utxos which are not `solvable` will not be consumed.

Fully Noded uses your change descriptor to derive 2 addresses and then creates 3
outputs utilizing the original receive address User A provided.

**The mining fee is equally deducted from the three outputs!**

This means whoever is on the receiving end of this transaction will be the one
paying at maximum 1/3 of the mining fee (the address User A originally provided
to initiate the tx).

Fully Noded will do its usual transaction analysis on the psbt and display all
the info to User A.

At this point User A may either sign the transaction and send it or optionally
export the psbt to User B.

## Peer to peer flow

At this point in time User A opts to export the blind psbt to User B.

- It will be exported fully encrypted, in [generic format](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md)
- Only Fully Noded will be able to decrypt the data into a psbt
- If the users wallet does not control the input the input data will be hidden

1. User A initiates the transaction as described in the first section
2. User A exports the psbt to User B
3. User B is automatically prompted to "add another blind psbt"
4. Fully Noded automatically creates another 3 inputs and 3 outputs as
described in the previous section as an independent psbt for user B
5. Fully Noded joins the two psbts with the `bitcoin-cli joinpsbt` command which
automatically shuffles all inputs and outputs
6. User B may either sign the transaction or export it to User C whereby the
above process can repeat indefinitely
7. User B opts to export the blind psbt to User C
8. User C opts to sign the the transaction
9. User C exports the psbt back to User B, who signs and exports to User A who
signs and broadcasts the transaction
10. All users rejoice in making the utxo set a bit more private for all parties involved üòÑ

## Dividing utxos

Fully Noded has a new "divide" feature for your utxos. Tap utxo(s) then tap ‚ûó

You will be prompted to choose an amount (0.1, 0.5, 0.05, 0.001 for now). This will
trigger Fully Noded to create a transaction that divides the specified utxos into those
amounts. Users will always need 3 identically denominated utxos to be able to create a
blind psbt, this tool helps to prep your utxos for Fully Noded, Samourai and
Wasabi coinjoins which support similar denominations.

### General info

- **It is recommended to export the psbts in file format as animated QR codes can be slow.**
- ***Blind psbts are encrypted to protect your privacy against people who are not involved in the coinjoin.***
- The final recipient will gain knowledge of which inputs and outputs are not his own!
- If only two people are involved then both parties will be able to identify each others addresses!

The more people who are involved the more obfuscation there is. `bitcoin-cli joinpsbts` shuffles
all inputs and outputs each time the psbt is passed to a new user, making it exponentially
more difficult to deduce whose addresses belong to who.
