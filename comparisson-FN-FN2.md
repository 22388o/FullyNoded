##What is this?
This table offers **a comparison of the differences and similarities of FN and FN2**, as far as objectives, features & functionality are concerned.

Although the names are very similar, FN and FN2, their objectives are different. FN2 will get another name soon. Anyway, to have a structured overview of the differences and similarities on various topics is far from a *"unnecessary luxury"*.
