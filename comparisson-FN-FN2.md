## What is this?
This table offers **a comparison of the differences and similarities of FN and FN2**, as far as objectives, features & functionality are concerned.

## Why relevant?
Although the names are very similar, FN and FN2, their objectives are different. FN2 will get another name soon. Anyway, to have a structured overview of the differences and similarities on various topics is far from a *"unnecessary luxury"*.

Both complement each other. The holy grail of bitcoin secure storage is multisig and not having to rely on one app/device/codebase/etc, both are capable of multisig and **can be independent signers for the same multisig wallet**.

FN gives you full access to your nodes bitcoin-cli api which will always be getting expanded on. FN allows you to import anything into it and use hot wallets on your node.

FN allows access to all wallets on your node whereas FN2 only allows access to FN2 wallets.

At the end of the day FN2 is a very focused wallet with ease of use in mind whereas FN is more of a power user enthusiasts tool/wallet.
