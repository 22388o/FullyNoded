Fully Noded single sig wallets are BIP84 but watch for and can sign for all address types, you may create invoices in any address format and still spend your funds. You will get a 12 word BIP39 recovery phrase to backup, these seed words are encrypted and stored using your devices secure enclave (no passphrase). Your node ONLY holds public keys. Your device will be able to sign for any derivation path and the encrypted seed is stored independently of your wallet. With Fully Noded your node will build an unsigned psbt then the device will sign it locally, acting like a hardware wallet, we then pass it back to your node as a fully signed raw transaction for broadcasting."
